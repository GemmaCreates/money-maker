### 90â€‘day execution plan (optimize for time and MRR)

  - Preâ€‘sell 10â€“20 annuals at discount; seed 3â€“5 pilot users for case studies.
  - Build shared backend: auth, usage tracking, Stripe, rate limits, logging.
  - Ship GPT "Earnings Call Analyst" v0 first (fastest path): upload link/CSV â†’ summary + Q&A.

- **Weeks 3â€“4: Publish + Proof**
  - Publish GPT with Actions and a crisp prompt + safety rails; record 60â€“90s demo; add 2 case studies.
  - Build and publish Raycast Trading Copilot v1: transcript/filing summarize, CSV import, Notion export, license key login.
  - Add Pro plan gates: alerts, saved watchlists, summary history.

- **Weeks 5â€“8: Distribution Engine**
  - Daily: 20 targeted cold messages (trading/PM creators, Discords, Reddit mods) + 10 partnership DMs (affiliates 20â€“30%).
  - Weekly: 1 teardown thread, 1 demo video, 1 miniâ€‘case study; run earlyâ€‘bird annual.
  - Raycast: request featuring; engage on store discussions; collect 10+ reviews.
  - GPT Store: optimize title/cover/instructions; ship "Compare Q vs Q" and "Peer Compare" tools.

  - Publish 5â€“10 public reviews/quotes; add 3 integrations (Notion, Google Drive, Email).
  - Double down on best channel; aim +20â€“30 net subs/day across GPT + Raycast.

### Budget (â‰¤ $5k) - API-Light Advantage
- **Build**: $500â€“$1.5k (icons, landing, UI polish).
- **Infra/APIs**: $20â€“$50/mo (minimal hosting, optional light LLM usage).
- **Distribution**: $3kâ€“$4k (more budget for marketing due to lower operational costs).
- **Contingency**: $500.

**ðŸŽ¯ API Cost Comparison:**
- **OLD PLAN**: $200-800/mo in API costs before first dollar of revenue
- **NEW PLAN**: $20-50/mo in operational costs = 90%+ cost reduction

### Metrics to track
- **North Star**: Paid subscriptions (Raycast + Pro API).
- **Activation**: First transcript summarized or first "Notes â†’ Tasks" run within 24h.
- **Timeâ€‘toâ€‘value**: Minutes to first highâ€‘quality output.
- **Outcome**: Research time saved; journaling streaks; tasks created/closed.
- **Channel**: Installs per store; CAC; conversion GPTâ†’Pro; churn.

### Risks & mitigations
- **Risk**: GPT Store monetization/policy shifts.
  - Mitigation: Keep own Stripe billing via Actionsâ€‘backed Pro; build audience offâ€‘platform.
- **Risk**: Data source friction (paywalled transcripts).
  - Mitigation: Userâ€‘provided uploads/links; support CSV; integrate free sources where allowed.
- **Risk**: LLM variance.
  - Mitigation: Deterministic prompts, evals, guardrails, retry policies, small model for drafts.

### Suggested stacks
- **Shared backend**: Node/TypeScript (Fastify/Express), Postgres/Prisma, Auth (email magic link), Stripe, PostHog, S3/R2 for files.
- **LLM**: OpenAI (gptâ€‘4oâ€‘mini / latest reasoning) + optional Anthropic for crossâ€‘checks.
- **Raycast extensions**: TypeScript, Raycast API; local settings for API key + license; telemetry optâ€‘in.
- **GPT with Actions**: OpenAPI spec for `/upload`, `/summarize`, `/qa`, `/compare`; OAuth or APIâ€‘key auth; rate limits and quotas.

### 2â€‘week build checklists (MLP)
