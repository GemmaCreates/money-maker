      third-party cloud database service that provides secure data storage and management.

      associated data at any time through the App settings. When you delete data, it is 
      permanently removed from our database.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Data Security</h3>
    <p>
      While we implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, no method of 
      transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee 
      absolute security of your information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Supabase</h3>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Apple Music / MusicKit</h3>

      your Apple Music account information, listening history, or personal music library data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      The App is designed for use by coaches and team administrators. While the App may contain 
      information about children (player names and jersey numbers), we do not knowingly collect

      parents through the Team Link feature.

      is available. If you are using the App from outside the United States, please be aware that 
      your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where 
      our servers are located.
    </p>
